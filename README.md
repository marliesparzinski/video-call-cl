# video-call

To run this project, clone the git repository to your machine.
cd to the folder where you cloned the project and type in your terminal `npm i`

When the dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev`.

You should get the message:

````App running at:
  - Local:   http://localhost:8082/
  - Network: http://192.168.178.150:8082/```

Now you can click on `http://localhost:8082` and your browser will open the video app for you.
Type in your name and go.

Now we have a mirror app. To actually chat with yourself, turn the sound of your computer off.
Then, open another browser tab (preferably in another window on another screen) and type in `http://localhost:8082`
Type in another name.
In the left, you should be able to see the name you added in the other tab. Click on that name and voila... you can see yourself twice :)
